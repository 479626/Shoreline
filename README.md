Shoreline takes place in a small island in the middle of the ocean, settlers named it ‘Skeleton Cove’, after the skeletal remains found within the cove when they had first arrived. Throughout the game with NPC (Non-Player Character) interactions, the player will learn about the devastation of the village through the many raids carried out by the pirate faction which the player will soon learn is the antagonist in the story.
